# JavaScript: `javascripting` Review

[nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) is an excellent free and open-source
resource for learning Node. We will use nodeschool in the future to help us
learn back-end web development using node. For now, we'll use the
[javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting) workshop to review
what we've learned so far.

## Instructions

1.  Install `javascripting`

    ```sh
    npm install -g javascripting
    ```

1.  Make a directory to store your work and move into that directory.
1.  Initialize a new git repository in that directory.
1.  Create a README ([example](https://github.com/jrhorn424/javascripting))
1.  Add and commit the README, create a remote on GitHub, and push.
1.  Run `javascripting` from the command line and follow the instructions.
1.  As you work, commit early and often.

Use commit messages as your learning journal, making notes of challenges and
what you learned by completing each exercise
([example](https://github.com/jrhorn424/learnyounode/commit/5db673a16d4af82d3c5a80240edeb93b0e4dbd0c)).
Then, push the repository to GitHub so future employers can get an idea of your
learning process (not to mention your tenacity!).
