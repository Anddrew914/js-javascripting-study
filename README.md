# JavaScript: `javascripting` Review

Use this template to structure your READMEs for studies. Remove text from this
section, or use it to frame the study. Good framing answers the question "Why am
I learning this?".

Be sure to include a recent [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and Markdown linter
configuration ([`.remarkrc`](.remarkrc)). Also, include an appropriate
`.gitignore`; these are usually found in specific technology templates, for
example [js-template](https://www.github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-template).
