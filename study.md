# JavaScript: `javascripting` Study

1.  Install `javascripting` by running `npm install --global javascripting` from
    the command line interface.
1.  Run `javascripting` from the command line interface and follow the
    instructions
1.  Commit early and often as you work.
1.  Add your work to the `lib` directory.

## Working Instructions

-   Work in `strict` mode to allow use of `let` and `const` (javascripting's
instructions will instruct you to use `var`).

-   Use commit messages as your learning journal, making notes of challenges and
what you learned by completing each exercise
([example](https://github.com/jrhorn424/learnyounode/commit/5db673a16d4af82d3c5a80240edeb93b0e4dbd0c)).
Then, push the repository to GitHub so future employers can get an idea of your
learning process (not to mention your tenacity!).

## Response

As noted previously, **no response is required** for this study. Complete the
workshop at your own pace as a review tool for fundamental JavaScript.

If you wish, you may open an issue. Include any questions you still have, or any
topic you want to explore further in a 1on1 meeting.

If you do this, be sure to schedule your 1on1 with a consultant and link to your
response issue, which will serve as an agenda for the meeting.
