# JavaScript: `javascripting` Review

This study is for your benefit. We do not expect a pull request. Do not fork and
clone. Instead, follow these directions (in order!):

1.  Install `javascripting`

    ```sh
    npm install -g javascripting
    ```

1.  Make a directory, `~/wdi/study/javascripting` to store your work and move
    into that directory.
1.  Initialize a new git repository in that directory.
1.  Create a README ([example](https://github.com/jrhorn424/javascripting))
1.  Add and commit the README, create a remote on GitHub, and push.
1.  Make and checkout a `study` branch off from `master` to work on.
1.  Run `javascripting` from the command line and follow the instructions.
1.  As you work, commit early and often.

Use commit messages as your learning journal, making notes of challenges and
what you learned by completing each exercise
([example](https://github.com/jrhorn424/learnyounode/commit/5db673a16d4af82d3c5a80240edeb93b0e4dbd0c)).
Then, push the repository to GitHub so future employers can get an idea of your
learning process (not to mention your tenacity!).

## Response

As noted previously, no response is required for this study. Complete the
workshop at your own pace as a review tool for fundamental JavaScript.

If you wish, you may open an issue. Include any questions you still have, or any
topic you want to explore further in a 1on1 meeting.

If you do this, be sure to schedule your 1on1 with a consultant and link to your
response issue, which will serve as an agenda for the meeting.
